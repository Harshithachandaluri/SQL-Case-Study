# SQL Practice in Healthcare Database

## About

This project centers on refining SQL skills using a healthcare database simulation. The database comprises tables for doctors, patients, wards, timetable, and medicines, interconnected through primary and foreign keys.

## Key Concepts Practiced

In this journey, a variety of SQL concepts have been explored, including:

- **Subqueries:** Delving into nested insights within the data.
- **Joins:** Connecting different tables like "doctors," "patients," "ward," and "medicines."
- **Group By:** Organizing data for insightful analysis, such as aggregating patient statistics by "ward."
- **Having:** Filtering aggregated data to pinpoint specific insights, for instance, identifying wards with high patient counts.
- **Aggregate Functions:** Utilizing functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, and `MAX()` to derive meaningful insights counting patient visits, or finding the average age of patients.
  

## Usage

The SQL queries crafted in this practice session can be employed for various analytical purposes within the healthcare domain.
